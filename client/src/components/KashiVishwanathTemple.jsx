      <p>
      The Kashi Vishwanath Temple, devoted to Lord Shiva, is one of Varanasi’s more prominent temples. This temple now belongs to the state of Uttar Pradesh. It was maintained by Dr Vibhuti Narayan Singh, then by Kashi Naresh, until 28 January 1983. It was built by Maharani Ahilyabai Holkar of Indore, a Maratha monarch ruling in 1780.
It is said that once the two superpowers, Lord Vishnu and Lord Brahma, argued about who was mightier. Lord Shiva pierced the world with a massive pillar of light to tackle this situation. Lord Vishnu, to prove himself, took the form of a boar, while Lord Brahma took the form of a swan. Brahma, out of his arrogance, falsely produces a flower as proof of him receiving that light first. Lord Shiva punished Lord Brahma after knowing the truth so that not he but Lord Vishnu would be worshipped at the same temple. 
The original Kashi Vishwanath temple was destroyed by Qutb-Ud-Din Aibak when he was looking after Kannauj. A Gujarati merchant rebuilt Vishwanath temple during the reign of Iltutmish, a Delhi sultan.

      <p>
      Kashi Vishwanath Temple and New Vishwanath Temple share a similar structure. The temple was created by Sri Madan Mohan Malaviya, BHU’s founder, and is constructed out of marble. The temple boasts the world’s tallest tower, standing at 253 feet. It is, in reality, a seven-temple complex. The Shiva temple sits on the ground floor, with the Durga and Lakshmi Narayan temples on the first floor. Stunning statues of Hindu gods and goddesses decorate the temple’s walls. There are small temples dedicated to Kala Bhairava(black god), Kartikeya(god of war), Avimukteshwra(god of learning), Vishnu, Ganesa, Shani, Shiva, and Parvati. A small well called the Jnana Vapi(wisdom well) is situated in the temple. The Jnana Vapi well sites to the North of the main temple were believed to have hidden the Jyotirlingas when the Mughals invaded it. The head priest of the temple jumped into the well with the Linga to protect the jyotirlinga from the invading army.</p><br></br>

      <p>The Kashi Vishwanath Temple is popularly known as the Golden Temple, due to the gold plating of its spire. One tonne of gold donated by Maharaja Ranjit Singh has been used in the gold plating, as well as in three domes, each made up of pure gold, donated in 1835. The temple receives around 3,000 visitors every day.</p><br></br>
