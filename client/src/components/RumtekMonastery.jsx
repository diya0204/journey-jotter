      <p>
      Rumktek monastery is situated at a distance of 24 km away from Gangtok, in a hillock, facing Gangtok. The Rumtek monastery is also known as the Dharma Chakra Center serves as the seat of His Holiness Gyawla Karmapa the XVI, the head of the Karma Kagyu order of Tibetan Buddhism. The monastery is the replica of the original monastery in Tsurpu in Tibet. The main monastery is a four storey structure building, fortified by the monk’s quarters.
The drive to Rumtek monastery meanders through the terraced paddy fields sprawled over a slope overlooking Gangtok. The entrance of the monastery is decorated with murals and the beautiful paintings of the four guarding deities of the four directions. Long round silk banners and ancient thankas are suspended on a red pillar inside the main shrine. One can also observe the beautiful paintings of Kargyu lineage and the Eight Bodhistavas. A ten feet high statue of Sakyamuni with Sariputra and Mangalputra is seen behind the throne of Gyalwa Karmapa.
The old Rumtek monastery is located fifteen minutes walk downhill from the Dharma Chakra Center. The monastery is dedicated to the 9th Gyalwa Karmapa. There is a statue of the 9th Karmapa in the main shrine and some beautiful wall paintings of Kargyu lineage  Vajradhara, Tilopa, Naropa, Narpa, milerapa, Gampopa, Karmabakshi and the 16th Karmapa are seen. It is believed that when the 9th Karmapa threw the holy rice after performing a ritual, four rice grains were scattered in Sikkim and one of the rice grain landed on the spot where the old Rumtek monastery is erected today.

      <h2 style={{ color: "#2980B9", fontSize: "2rem"}}>🌟 Why Visit Rumtek Monastery?</h2><br />
      <p>
      The earthy smell of incense wafts through the crisp mountain air as it reverberates with the sound of gongs. Little monks faithfully chant hymns in the cavernous prayer hall while the older ones go about their daily chores in the monastery’s living quarters. Rumtek, apart from being the largest monastery in the Himalayan state of Sikkim is also one of the most venerated. The monastery, perched on a hill facing Gangtok offers a brilliant view of the city and the surrounding mountains. Built in the 1960s, the monastery is the main seat of the Black Hat or the Karma Kagyu, a sect within the Nyingma school of Buddhism that originated around the 12th century in Tibet.
The gompa, an epitome of Tibetan architecture, was designed by the 16th Karmapa, Rangjung Rigpe Dorje himself based on his memories of the Tsurphu Monastery of Tibet, the original headquarter of the Black Hat order. Tsurphu was completely destroyed by Chinese authorities in 1966.
The façade of the main temple—elaborately covered with ornate latticework in wood and painted in vibrant colours that are characteristic of sacred Tibetan art— overlooks a sprawling courtyard. The prayer hall is adorned with intricate murals depicting Buddhist masters, demons and dakinis while brilliantly-painted thangkas festoon its walls. Behind the main temple is The Karma Shri Nalanda Institute of Buddhist Studies, one of the grandest and busiest structures in the monastery complex. Monks spend nine years studying the doctrines of Mahayana Buddhism here. It also functions as their living quarters, kitchen and dining area. The ashes of the 16th Karmapa are also preserved here in a gilded stupa.
