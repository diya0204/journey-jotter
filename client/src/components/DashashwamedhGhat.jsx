      <p>
      Dashashwamedh Ghat has been around for a very long time. There are two Hindu stories about the ghat. One says that Brahma built it to welcome Shiva, and the other says that this is where Lord Brahma is said to have sacrificed 10 horses for Lord Shiva, and the name ‘Dashashwamedh’ itself translates to ‘ten sacrificial horses’.
Dashashwamedh Ghat is one of the oldest and most important ghats of Varanasi. It is believed to be the site of the Brahmaresta, where worship of Brahma was first performed by Lord Brahma himself. People also think that the Bhara Shiva Naga kings did the ten horse sacrifice in the second century. Even before Varanasi was known as the City of Temples, it has been a sacred centre of pilgrimage for Hindus.
Peshwa Balaji Baji Rao built the current ghat in the year 1748. A few decades later, in 1774, the Queen of Indore, Ahilyabahi Holkar, rebuilt the ghat. On December 7, 2010, a small blast shook the southern end of the aarti at the Sitla Ghat. This hurt 37 people, six of whom were foreigners and two people were killed. It was claimed by the Indian Mujahideens that they were responsible for the attack.

      <h2 style={{ color: "#2980B9", fontSize: "2rem"}}>⚔️ Significance</h2><br />
      <p>Dashashwamedh Ghat is one of the most sacred places in Varanasi and it holds great religious significance. Many pilgrims make the journey to Dashashwamedh Ghat to experience its deep religious significance. People come to the ghat to bath in the Ganges River and to perform religious rituals. There are several ancient temples as well as numerous small religious shrines nearby.
When you spend some time here, you feel like you’re sitting in heaven. The beautiful scenes of the sun rising in the morning and setting in the evening give the water of the Ganges its unique color. Some followers come here every morning for taking a holy bath in the Ganges and to pay homage to their Lord.
In old texts, Dashashwamedha Ghat is called Rudra Sarovar Ghat, and the part of the Ganga that flows in front of it is called Rudra Sarovar Tirtha. It is believed that a holy dip in Rudra Sarovar Tirtha will wash away all your sins and help you break free from the circle of birth and death.</p>
