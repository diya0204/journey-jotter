      <p>
      The construction of the palace was started in 1551 by Maharana Amar Singh, continued by Maharana Karan Singh(1620–1628) and finally completed by Maharana Jagat Singh I(1628–1652). It is named as Jagat Mandir in honour of the last named Maharana Jagat Singh. The royal family used the palace as a summer resort and pleasure palace for holding parties. The palace served as a refuge to asylum seekers for one occasion. During the revolt in 1857, Maharana Swroop Singh(1842–1861) saved a number of European families, mostly women and children from Neemuch, which were given refuge in the Jag Mandir Palace. The revolt was popularly known as the Sepoy Mutiny, and was also called the Indian Mutiny,(or the first War of Independence) against the British Raj.
After the Independence of India from the British rule, on 15 August 1947, at the initiative of Maharana Bhupal Singh, the Mewar kingdom merged with the Indian union in 1949 along with other princely states of Rajasthan.

      <p>
      The temple of Jagdish is a magnificent and stunning temple still located in the City Palace complex of the stunning city of Udaipur in Rajasthan. The temple of Shri Jagdish is committed to Lord Vishnu, who is called Lord Laxmi Narayan and is assumed to be the most temple in the whole city of Udaipur. It is said the truth, a passage to this excellent temple of Bara Pol can be seen from the city palace. The wonderful carvings, attractive statues and the tranquility of this place of love are an ideal choice for those looking for comfort and confidence.
The Indian-style Jagdish-temple was designed and built in 1651 by Maharaja Jagat Singh, who ruled Udaipur from 1628 to 1653. Two enormous elephants made of stone welcome you at the entrance to the corridor. What you will see next is a stone piece engraved with inscriptions that refer to Maharaja Jagat Singh. A marble journey takes you to the main place of worship, where you will discover a metal model of Garuda, half a man and half a falcon, which remains as if guarding the entrance of Lord Vishnu.
The main altar embraces the four-sided statue of Lord Vishnu, which was cut from one stone of dark stone. The holy place of Lord Jagdish was found half way, surrounded by four small altars. These altars are dedicated to the Lord Ganesha, the sun god, the goddess of Shakti and the Lord Shiva alone. The air is wrapped inside the altar with absolute calm and tranquility which is an ordeal that you should not miss.
