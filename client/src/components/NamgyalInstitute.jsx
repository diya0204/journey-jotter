      <p>
      It is one of the most important and famous institutes in the world that does research in the areas of Tibetan language and culture. It also has in its premises a museum, a Tibetan library with rich collections and also a reference center about Tibet and Himalayas in general.
Located in Deorali and less than 2 kilometers from the main town of Gangtok, the institute is perched in a small forest of birch trees, oak and magnolia … a wonderful serene ambience.
The main building is built on Tibetan architecture and remains as one of the finest traditional Tibetan designs in the world. The foundation stone of the Institute was laid by 14th Dalai Lama in February 1957. It was inaugurated by Late Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in October 1958.
The museum is located in the ground floor and has many rare collections of statues, coins, thangkas(that are scrolls with hand paintings &Â embroidery work), Tibetan art work &Â objects, and ancient manuscripts in Sanskrit, Tibetan, Chinese and Lepcha.
However the most prominent of all is the grand and majestic image of Manjushri(bodhisattva of knowledge and wisdom) which was brought all the way from Tibet.
he library is located in the first floor of the building and holds one of the largest collections of Tibetan documents and literatures in the world.
It has over 60,000 volumes that include translation of original teachings of Lord Buddha, thesis and articles from imminent Buddhist scholars from all over the world, and xylographs(that are created from wooden plates where the transcripts are embossed in reverse order).
The land area of the institute was donated by the late King of Sikkim Tashi Namgyal and hence such name of the institute. Next to the institute main premises you will find a bronze statue of the last king of Sikkim – Chogyal Palden Thondup Namgyal.
Just opposite to the Institute premises is a nice Gift &Â souvenir shop known asÂ Asta Mangala Art. It has many nice and intricate items including German silverware, typical Sikkimese clothing for women etc. All items are very reasonably priced.
