      <p>
      The history of Assi Ghat goes back thousands of years. There is a mythical tale that describes how the river Assi originated. It is believed that while the goddess Durga was fighting the demon Shumbha and Nishumbha, her sword struck the ground when she destroyed them, which resulted in the formation of a stream, which is today known as the river Assi. After achieving victory over the demons Shumbha and Nishumbha, Durga went to rest at Durga Kund, which is located in close proximity to Assi Ghat. As a result of the ghat’s location on this bank of the Ganges, which is where the Assi River meets up with the Ganges, it was given the name the Assi Ghat.
The Assi Ghat also has mentions in Sanskrit literature such as Padma Purana, Matsya Purana, Kurma Purana, Agni Purana, and Kashi Khanda. Hindus think that Tulsidas died at Assi Ghat and went to heaven. After the bombing in Varanasi in 2010, the city provided more police to the Assi Ghat area to deal with any problems tourists might have.
